Channels is a social media platform that serves as a virtual community where users can share, discuss, and discover a wide range of topics and interests.
It is organized into individual subcommunities, known as channels, which are dedicated to user-specified subjects.
Users can post text, images, videos, or links and engage in conversations through comments and "push"s or "pull"s to determine the visibility and ranking of content.
